         <h1>Programming Langauges</h1>
         <p>Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages</p>
         <h2>Java</h2>
         <p><strong>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language</strong> that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.<em> The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</em></p>  
         <h2>Python </h2>
         <p><strong>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language</strong>. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its<em> object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code</em> for small and large-scale projects.</p>
